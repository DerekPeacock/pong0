# PyGame: Simple example graphics game
This game is being developed to explore Python and PyGame as a way of teaching Python.  So far the game includes:-
1. Defining a Red Rectangle
2. Displaying the rectangle
3. Moving that rectangle in four directions plus Jump
4. Loading a background image
5. Loading the image of a character
6. Displaying these images.
7. Refactoring by defining movePaddle() and draw()

The game no longer runs after the functions were defined
